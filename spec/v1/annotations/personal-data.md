## Introduction

The processing of personal data is key in business processes. SAP's products must enable our customers to operate their applications in compliance with data protection laws. One way of enabling is applying DPP-related annotations. Via those annotations the specific DPP-related behavior can be enabled by the consumers. The annotations are derived from existing personal data annotations in OData and OpenAPI.
