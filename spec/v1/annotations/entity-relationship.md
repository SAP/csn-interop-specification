## Introduction

> TEST

Modern business application suites handle thousands of different types of business data and consist of many applications or services.
Business data is heavily interconnected and dynamically evolves over time.

It is not possible to put all data together into a single API covering all relations between data. On the contrary, many smaller APIs are easier to develop and maintain.
As a consequence, many relations between different types of data go across different APIs.
Additionally, the same type of data can be offered by different APIs, either in different API versions, technologies, or even hosted by different technical systems and providers.

Therefore, independent concepts for types of data (so called [entity types](#entity-type)) and for their identifiers (via so called [property types](#property-type)) are needed, which can be used for the flexible definition of references and relations across the local boundary.
