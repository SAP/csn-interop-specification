## Introduction

[Open Resource Discovery](https://sap.github.io/open-resource-discovery/) (ORD) is a complementary standard to CSN Interop.
It's purpose is to provide a decentralized protocol for metadata publishing and discovery of applications and services.
From ORD perspective, CSN Interop is a possible resource definition format that can be attached to API and Event resources.

On the ORD level, more high-level context can be found and expressed, that is shared across different protocols and standards.
Also it covers (global) taxonomy and relationships between high-level concepts.

With this annotations it's possible to connect the CSN Interop concepts back to the high-level ORD concepts.
