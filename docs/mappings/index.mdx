# Data Format Mappings

This section describes the mappings to and from the (conceptual) CSN Type system to other data formats / type systems.

It is important to understand that the CSN type system itself is on an abstract level only.
Which concrete data type is used when serializing and parsing the actual values is therefore not defined by CSN itself.
It depends on the target API Protocol and the chosen mapping to a data format / type system.
